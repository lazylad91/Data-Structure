/**
 * Two elements of a binary search tree (BST) are swapped by mistake.

Recover the tree without changing its structure.

Note:
A solution using O(n) space is pretty straight forward. Could you devise a constant space solution?
 * 
 * 
 * This question appeared difficult to me but it is really just a simple in-order traversal! I got really frustrated when other people are showing off Morris Traversal which is totally not necessary here.

Let's start by writing the in order traversal:

private void traverse (TreeNode root) {
   if (root == null)
      return;
   traverse(root.left);
   // Do some business
   traverse(root.right);
}
So when we need to print the node values in order, we insert System.out.println(root.val) in the place of "Do some business".

What is the business we are doing here?
We need to find the first and second elements that are not in order right?

How do we find these two elements? For example, we have the following tree that is printed as in order traversal:

6, 3, 4, 5, 2

We compare each node with its next one and we can find out that 6 is the first element to swap because 6 > 3 and 2 is the second element to swap because 2 < 5.

Really, what we are comparing is the current node and its previous node in the "in order traversal".*/
